3rd gear during first few minutes of driving .\\n5     The transmission is horrible, it shifts revs horribly at the wrong times, it putters when it hits 1 1 2 rpms while coasting unless you rev it or hit the breaks, if you try to start the car in really cold weather it makes a horrible grinding noise, the dash rattles ALL the time, when I try to accelerate getting on the freeway it doesnt move & scares me and when it does move it revs even after take your foot from the gas .\\n6

          The transmission doesn't shift correctly, and it has almost caused me to get into an accident twice .\\n7

                                                     Unlike the common concerns with the transmission, all of my concerns problems are with everything other than the drivetrain .\\n9

                                   The navigation display shows more information, such as next turn street and speed limit, and the picture update is smooth instead of jerky as I have seen in other

                                                                                                                                                   Use the  Webupdater  so that the unit is running at

directions after the obstruction has been cleared is not a good option .\\n34                                                                                                                                                          It can be done by phone but if you do it that way you don't get the one free update on the maps .\\n35

straight out of the box, and when the GPS shows that it is acquiring signals   don't skip that .\\n38                                                                                                         I also like the fact that Garmin makes the most recent map updates available   rather than leave users hanging like some other GPS manufacturers .\\n39

need for the cell phone connection or traffic updates, just wanted a navigator to guide me from point A to point B as I get lost easily in my own town and to set up long trips .\\n50

3rd gear during first few minutes of driving .\\n5     The transmission is horrible, it shifts revs horribly at the wrong times, it putters when it hits 1 1 2 rpms while coasting unless you rev it or hit the breaks, if you try to start the car in really cold weather it makes a horrible grinding noise, the dash rattles ALL the time, when I try to accelerate getting on the freeway it doesnt move & scares me and when it does move it revs even after take your foot from the gas .\\n6

          The transmission doesn't shift correctly, and it has almost caused me to get into an accident twice .\\n7

                                                     Unlike the common concerns with the transmission, all of my concerns problems are with everything other than the drivetrain .\\n9

come with a standard power cable or even a USB cable ,  especially considering that is what you must have to use for software updates and product registration .\\n25

                                                                                                                                 I found the maps to be inaccurate at first, but after I updated them from Garmin's website everything is golden .\\n30                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Otherwise you can't update the maps !\\n31

                                                                                                                                                   Use the  Webupdater  so that the unit is running at its peak .\\n33                                                                                 I avoided the more complex ones as I had read that FM updates can confuse the device and changing directions after the obstruction has been cleared is not a good option .\\n34                                                                                                                                                          It can be done by phone but if you do it that way you don't get the one free update on the maps .\\n35                                                                                                                                                            I updated to the latest 2010 map soon after I received the unit, so the map is accurate to me .\\n36                                                                                                                                                                         I also like the way that it connects to the internet   to update all of its maps .\\n37                                                                                                  All I can really say about this, is update the Firm Ware straight out of the box, and when the GPS shows that it is acquiring signals   don't skip that .\\n38                                                                                                         I also like the fact that Garmin makes the most recent map updates available   rather than leave users hanging like some other GPS manufacturers .\\n39                                                                                                                                                                                                   Once you have the unit, you'll want to update the maps .\\n40                                                                                                                                                               Once receiving the unit, you get one map update download which must be used within 60 days .\\n41                                                                                                                       One guy posted on the forum that he had an older device and paid to update to the 2009 map 12 hours before the 2010 map was posted .\\n42

updated maps at the Garmin website .\\n44                                                                                                                                            More often than not, the estimated arrival time is updated 1, 2 minutes before the last expected arrival time .\\n45                                                                                                                                                                   Map update ,  when you register it on, line   you get an offer for one free map update .\\n46                                                                                                                                                  I plan to wait almost the full 60 days to get the latest update, then probably never purchase an update .\\n47                                                                                                                                                                                              By the time it needs a new update the unit will be obsolete .\\n48                                                                                                                                                                                          MapSource also makes it easy to update your unit's map annually .\\n49                                                                I have no need for the cell phone connection or traffic updates, just wanted a navigator to guide me from point A to point B as I get lost easily in my own town and to set up long trips .\\n50                                                                                                                  The only nitpick disappointment was when I downloaded the free 2010 map update it dosn't show road extensions completed a few years ago .\\n51                                                                                                                                                                                           Getting the prompted software update might have corrected that .\\n52

a 2GB map update and 3 hours to install the program to the GPS .\\n55

was that I paid $50 less for the 750 and it came with the FM transmitter cable and a USB cord to connect it to your computer for updates and downloads .\\n0

zoom levels   you have to reduce the amount of detail displayed .\\n2

endangering yourself and others on the road and after the voice updates the Garmin put out for the 255W the scratchiness and robotic sounding voice became crisp and very audible .\\n4                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ,

cheaper by $25 and they told me that I needed to buy a memory card to download map updates .\\n6                                                                                                                                         Another big name site did the same thing and told me that I would have to pay Garmin to update to the latest maps .\\n7                                                                                 The navigation display shows more information, such as next turn street and speed limit, and the picture update is smooth instead of jerky as I have seen in other models .\\n8                                                                              Finally, be carefull around Washington DC, because this unit has not updated the actual and latest detours arownd monuments and buildings, therefore taking you to dead ends .\\n9                                                                                                                                                                                      This clearly shows how often the map updates even when sitting still .\\n10                                                                                                                           Upon plugging my Nuvi 255w in the PC for the first time, it immediately informed me of both a software update and a map update .\\n11

                                         The map update was about 2GB in size .\\n13                                                                                                                  I have Comcast cable Internet and a quad, core PC with 4gb of ram and the map update took a little over an hour to download and install .\\n14

 I have held off from getting any GPS unit for a long time because I have a book of maps for the United States and I have always been able to update the travel  atlas  and supplement that with free maps from the internet via Google, Yahoo, etc .\\n16

                                                    Also make sure you update the unit software from the Garmin website on a regular basis .\\n32

obstruction has been cleared is not a good option .\\n34                                                                                                                                                          It can be done by phone but if you do it that way you don't get the one free update on the maps .\\n35

                                                                                                                                      I also like the way that it connects to the internet   to update all of its maps .\\n37                                                                                                  All I can really say about this, is update the Firm Ware straight out of the box, and when the GPS shows that it is acquiring signals   don't skip that .\\n38                                                                                                         I also like the fact that Garmin makes the most recent map updates available   rather than leave users hanging like some other GPS manufacturers .\\n39

he had an older device and paid to update to the 2009 map 12 hours before the 2010 map was posted .\\n42

anything I didn't already know after fiddling with it for 10 minutes .\\n2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     It also does not offer an option to view the route as a series of turn by turn directions .\\n3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   It gives your heading not in terms of degres but only in terms of one of eight directions   .\\n4                                                                                                                                                                             The widescreen is a plus and I highly recommend it, even though it has the wide screen you can stick it in your back pocket which can be conveniently used for walking directions .\\n5

is a handy little device that provides excellent value, but more importantly spot on directions .\\n6                                                 While I recommend that you refrain from entering a directions request while driving your car, I note that some of the more impressive features of this GPS are literally one touch away, and so mounting the device close enough to you to activite a one touch feature would seem to be relatively important .\\n7                                                                                                       But leaving it on the seat next to you is likely to cause a few double takes because as comfortable as you think you're going to be just listening for directions, the fact remains that the graphics will attract your eyeballs like a moth to a flame .\\n8                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         I've found the directions in major metropolitan areas to be excellent .\\n9                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               but for the most part, we find that the Garmin software provides accurate directions, whereever we intend to go .\\n10                                                                                                                                         Another screen at the touch of the button will show you the turn by turn directions coming up so that you can plan even better, especially in areas that you have just enough familiarity to be considered dangerous .\\n11

directions when it isn't necessary .\\n12                                                                                                                                       The only other annoyance of any time is that if you deviate from your route and don't indicate that you are detouring, you get to hear the Garmin repeatedly chastize you because it has to recalulate your directions .\\n13

allows for detours with directions on how to get back .\\n16

                               Traffic directions are as good and detailed as can be, as you would expect from a Garmin, and less intrusive than on some other brands .\\n18

like the highway sign says, or like I would verbally tell someone to take if giving them directions .\\n33

can look at the screen to see the exit I need to take .\\n34

Interstates .\\n35                                                                                                                                                                                                                       It lost satellite contact a couple of times on the trip   but apparently picked them up again because there were no skipped directions .\\n36

                    The spoken directions are generally easy to understand .\\n38

entertaining and not an issue .\\n39                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   It does know when you are not near a public road but it cannot give directions to the road .\\n40

would be its inability to show 1, way streets on your overhead map   and that this particular model does not support the Garmin routing feature that you can sync between your PC and their more expensive models to pick multiple waypoints instead of just a point 'A' to point 'B' directions system .\\n42

and Google Maps has features that work with Garmin units .\\n43                                                                                                                                         Any time you're facing a closed roadway or are terribly stuck in highway traffic, you'll get a very slick change in directions to your destination given to you in literally less than 5 seconds than you ask for it .\\n44

                                                    The purpose of the GPS is to give me directions in unfamiliar locations .\\n46

         The voice directions are great, but sometimes it mispronounces names .\\n47                                                                                                                                                                 It takes a little while to get the satellites sometimes, but I just set it up as soon as I get in the car and by the time I'm out on the road and actually need directions it's up and going .\\n48                                                                                                                                                                                                                       I had a great time torturing the poor thing and deliberately not following its directions while driving one day in downtown Sacramento .\\n49

                                                                                                                                 I avoided the more complex ones as I had read that FM updates can confuse the device and changing directions after the obstruction has been cleared is not a good option .\\n51

seems to be clearing his throat at the end of his directions .\\n52

when I miss a turn .\\n53                                                                                                                                                                                                        Often when I'd get a phone call or was talking to someone, it would have been nice to just have the ability to quickly make the voice directions mute .\\n54

     The directions were pretty right on, with a brief glitch with the distance it was calculating for some approaching streets .\\n55

boasts, but for basic travel directions for the non, techie then this is a great product .\\n56

Nuvi in the glove box of her car, pulling it out, plugging it in, and getting directions whenever she needs, in a manner that notably is much faster and clearer than reading a map or calling her

were following me for directions .\\n62

place to another without having to look up at the GPS, but of course you also get turn, by, turn directions on the GPS with a touch of the screen .\\n64

which I chose for its ability to adjust the directions if you reroute, text to speech feature and 4 .\\n65

took a roadtrip with no  squabbling  about directions .\\n66

seconds .\\n67

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          I was so tired of having to go to Mapquest and print out directions .\\n69

fair warning when you are about to take a turn, which is really important .\\n70

directions with amazing accuracy .\\n71

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The directions the GPS gave me were absolutely correct  , but the name of the highway was wrong .\\n73                                                                                                                                                                                                     Wish I had bought it about two years ago rather than spend a lot on maps and wasting time asking directions, especially in relatively remote areas of ME .\\n74

around the Mid, West following Mapquest maps and directions .\\n75                                                                                                                                             I chose small towns as destinations and it always led me there without any problems, thus allowing me to enjoy the scenery of the fall foliage without worrying about using a map for directions or getting lost .\\n76                                                                                                                                                                                                                      I use the map feature when I don't need directions which makes it easier to identify streets when street signs are obscured or missing  .\\n77                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    On the negative side, the directions it gives to a given address are not always the best way to get there .\\n78

                              It can be a little distracting the first few times you use it, but once you find the right mounting spot, it s like it's not there until you need it and then it's there

directions from passengers like spouses and children who have difficulty reading conventional paper maps .\\n92                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Others have said that the voice directions leave something to be desired in terms of volume and clarity .\\n93

when necessary .\\n94                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   But driving on the highway with music on and windows down, it will be hard to hear the directions using just 70% of volume .\\n95                                                                                                                                                                               I didnt know the address of the mueseum so I typed it into the unit and it found not only the meuseum, but the nearest garage, the places to eat, and directions were right ON .\\n96

          The display is very easy to read, and the directions were very good .\\n97                                                                                                                                                                               The model 255W that we received seemed to take longer to find a satelite, and the man's voice was very fast and not as clear, and at times seemed a bit confused in directions .\",\n          \"

are on opposite sides of the screen .\\n2                                                                                                                                                                   The screen is easily readable in the sun, and I love how it automatically dims to 20% at night .\\n3                                                                Display is excellent ,  the layout of information on the screen is very good showing upcoming turns at the top, your speed, the local speed limit and the estimated time of arrival at the bottom .\\n4          The text to speech is great for not having to look down at the screen endangering yourself and others on the road and after the voice updates the Garmin put out for the 255W the scratchiness and robotic sounding voice became crisp and very audible .\\n5                                                                                The widescreen is a plus and I highly recommend it, even though it has the wide screen you can stick it in your back pocket which can be conveniently used for walking directions .\\n6

                                                                                                                                            If you are looking for a simple wide screen GPS the Nuvi 255W is the right choice .\\n8                                                                                                                    One of my favorite features on the Garmin 255W is the odometer screen that will allow you to track all sorts of data about your long car trip .\\n9                                                                                                                                             It tells you on the main screen your estimated time of arrival which will change depending upon your stops and speed .\\n10                                                                                                                                                                                         Additionally, I find the data in the odometer screen to be fasscinating .\\n11                                            Another screen at the touch of the button will show you the turn by turn directions coming up so that you can plan even better, especially in areas that you have just enough familiarity to be considered dangerous .\\n12                                                                                                                                                                         ,  255w has an arrow at the top of the screen that shows the direction of the next turn .\\n13                                                                                                                                                                        To make things worse, in the the  Main st  may not be on the screen on the default scale .\\n14                                                                                                                                                                                 The way map is displayed is good and the wide screen helps to see more map area .\\n15                                                    Other than the Magellan's screen being an inch smaller ,  but really noticeable ,  the Magellan did not have text to voice, and often would take a much longer route even though we told it to take freeways .\\n16                                                                                      The most noticeable thing is that the screen is much easier to read, and that the text to voice is extremely valuable and much better than a beep just as you need to turn .\\n17                                                                                    On the other hand, after about a week of using the Garmin, it seems to understand where we are, and now POIs as far as 25 miles away will show up when the screen is touched .\\n18

that when I see a speed limit sign on the road, indicating a change of speed limit for that road, the Nuvi is not far behind in changing the speed limit on the screen .\\n26                                                                                                                                                               If you missed the spoken directions, you can look at the top of the

doesn't verbalize those directions, I can look at the screen to see the exit I need to take .\\n28

map .\\n33                                                                                                                         The extra features of the 255W over lesser models that I find highly beneficial include spoken street names and the wide screen display .\\n34                                                                                                                                                                                                   Now the only screen I get says the system software is missing .\\n35                                                                                              I use the suction cup mount because I like to keep the screen in my frame of vision without turning my head, but I make sure to take it with me when I park my car .\\n36                                                                                                                                                             From the map screen it's but 2 presses on the large and accessible touchscreen to get a  Where Am I ?\\n37    I also realize that even if I crashed differently I had been injured in other ways but the car were still drivable that it's but 1 press on the screen to get direction to the nearest emergency services   from that lovely screen that told me where I was .\\n38                                                                                                                                                                                                                                I just wish the screen is larger .\\n39                                                                                                                                                                                                         1 Wanted a wide screen model, its difficult to see the 4 \\n40                                                                                                   4 It has built in picture viewer and a card slot, so insert your memory card, browse to picture browser and you don't need a PC, has enough big screen to enjoy\\n41                                                                                                                                                                      Its for wide screen models and it fits perfectly my 255w with a flap that covers it screen .\\n42                                                                                                                                                     I chose a hard type of case that zippered the screen in, as I didn't want the possibility of it sliding out .\\n43                                                                                                                                             Also, it's hard to view the screen when it's super sunny outside, but the text to speech capability is an advantage .\\n44                                                                                                                         Before I get into the specifics of my review, let me offer one important piece of advice , ,  BUY A CARRYING CASE to protect the screen !\\n45                                                                                                 These gadgets have sensitive touchscreen menus, and I think the fact that I didn't protect the screen on my last GPS is the reason it died after only 14 months .\\n46                                                                                                                                                                                             I had a Nuvi 205 and I really liked it but I wanted a bigger screen .\\n47                                                                                                                                                                 It's an emergency location feature ,  you can tap the screen to get your latitude and longitude .\\n48                                                                                                                                                                                       BUT, in direct sunlight, the screen is difficult to see in my convertible .\\n49                                                                                                                             Not only the voice gives turn, by, turn instructions, the map on the screen also has a thick purple line indicating the route ahead .\\n50                                                                                                                                        The local  speed limit  is shown on left side of the screen with current driving speed shown at the bottom of the screen .\\n51                                                                                                                                                                    One thing that would be useful is putting a mute button on the screen available at all times .\\n52                                                                                                                                                                 Having the speed limit show up on the screen was also great since I was in unfamiliar territory .\\n53                                                                                                                                     I watched the screen several times as I passed by a speed limit sign, and it would change almost immediately as I passed by !\\n54                                  I was afraid the screen on one of these things would be too small for me to see, and the last thing I need would be futzing around with a GPS screen when I'm on the road if I wanted to do that, I could drive and read a map !\\n55                                                                                                                                                                                                              The screen is huge next to some of the units I saw .\\n56                                                                                                                                                  I have no problems reading it in bright sunlight, but with the voice to text, the screen is almost unnecessary .\\n57                                                                                                                                                                               It has a very clear and bright screen and is loaded with multiple useful features .\\n58                                                                                                                                                              It has a great screen presentation that is very easy to read when it is mounted on your windshield .\\n59                                                                                                                                                                                                         3 inch screen was a slight improvement over my former 3 .\\n60                                                                                                                                                                                                The screen is crystal clear and the voice in it is nice and loud .\\n61                                                                                                                                                                                              The screen is large so that it is easily read while you're driving .\\n62                                                                                                                                                                                                              The wide screen and spoken street names are a must .\\n63                                                             If I'm listening to loud music, I won't be able to hear the exact words but I can hear it vaguely and that is a cue that I should glance down at the top of the screen and see what my next move is .\\n64                                                                                                                                                     There should be an external volume control on the unit, or at least volume control from the main map screen .\\n65                                                                                                                                                                                                         The posted speed limit on the screen is pretty cool too .\\n66                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Also, push every icon on every screen you see .\\n67                                                                                                                             In both instances this could have been avoided if I had just paid attention to the screen which showed the correct road highlighted .\\n68                                                                                                                                                    The dashboard mount keeps the unit easily within reach so that you can safely touch the screen while driving .\\n69                                                                                            Was thinking about buying the 265WT for only $45 more, but decided I didn't need bluetooth or the Traffic Feature which gives you flash advertisements on the screen .\\n70                                                                                                                         Those are the only 2 differences between the 2 models and I'd rather not have flash advertisements coming up on my GPS screen at random .\\n71                                                                                                                                                                                            3 Inch screen is awesome to look at both during the day and at night .\\n72                                       The Voice Prompted turn by turn directions make it easy to get from one place to another without having to look up at the GPS, but of course you also get turn, by, turn directions on the GPS with a touch of the screen .\\n73                                          The screen is clear and the instructions are good though again if you have a lot of exits or turns all in the same spot you have to be careful to just listen to the voice and watch the road or you can miss the turn .\\n74                                                                                                                                                                                                 The screen is big enough to view maps, street names, etc easily .\\n75

                                                    Now if Garmin would put a compass on the main screen always pointing to the north, it would be perfect .\\n77

                                       One down side is the lack of volume button on the unit you have to adjust the volume form the tool menu on the screen which can be a challenge if you want to change the volume when you are driving .\\n91                                                                                                                                                After lots of internet research, we settled on the Garmin 255W for the text, to, speech and wide screen features .\\n92

                                                                                                                                                                    The wide screen is important because of the better keyboard   .\\n94                                                                                                                                                  We started with a non, touch screen which was great, then we updated to the streetpilot C330 which was a dream .\\n95                                                                                                                                                After ample research   I selected the Nuvi 255W for it's abundant features, wider screen and voice communication .\\n96                                                                                                                                                                           Looking at comparable units, this one seems to have more features and a larger screen .\\n97                                                                                                                                                                                                            I can even see the screen without my reading glasses .\\n98                                                                                                                                                                     It speaks the street names if you touch the car on the screen it lets you know lat and long .\\n99                                                                                                                                                              Screen size is good and I didn't want one that had blue tooth and a lot of 'extras' I wouldn't use .\\n100                                                                                                                                                                               With either unit, the text on the screen usually tells you what you need to know .\\n101                                                                                                                                          I've only used the wide screen versions, so I can't compare, but I personally wouldn't want to go to a smaller screen .\\n102                                                                               The Garmin nuvi 255W I bought through Amazon has a dead red pixel which is always on and what is worse is that the position of that red dot is right in the middle of the screen .\"\n

                                  I bought the nano as a replacement for an older classic, which was a great unit but time has taken it's toll on the battery and screen .\\n56

                                                             The only for sure complaint I have is the seats seems to hurt my back after I drove for a period of time, this may be because I am use to my silverado truck with leather bucket seats .\\n30                 DON'T rely on your test drive, the seats are Very uncomfortable and when the engine goes into the  econo  mode the vehicle  shifts rocks violently  forward and when leaving the  econo  mode it shifts rocks forward once again which means that the vehicle is  CONTINUOUSLY  SHAKING AND ROCKING .\\n31

front seats are extremely uncomfortable after anything more than 15 minutes of driving due to what I see as a design flaw, the seat curvature is too great, and even with the lumbar support all the way retracted, it still feels like there is some type of bar sticking out in the wrong part of my back   .\\n34                                                                                                                However, long, distance comfort  is poor due to hard, narrow and deeply, bucketed seats combined with a very taut suspension which transmits even minor road imperfections through the whole vehicle .\\n35                                                                                                                                                  At first the seats seemed stiffer than I'd like, but after making a 2 1 2 hour trip, It felt very comfortable once I got the seat and lumbar adjusted to my liking .\\n36

    The ride, comfort, and drive is as expected, however, the quality and reputation of yore are completely gone for the flagship Camry .\\n45                                                                                       Over the month it was in the shop, we rented several different cars and nothing seemed to measure up to the comfort and options of the Camry .\\n46

longer trips, however, they have a tendency to fall asleep, , which I think emphasizes how comfortable, smooth, and quiet it is .\\n80

             I test drove and compared similar 4 door sedans like the Maxima, Accord, Mazda6, and noticed that none had all the features,performance,comfort ,safety,and looks that the Camry has .\\n82                                                                                                                                                                                 The navigation works

                            The seats were very comfortable on a four and a half hour   trip, and wind and road noise were minimal .\\n86

the 2007 Camry to be the most uncomfortable cockpit I have every been in .\\n90                                                                                                The headrest presses into

                                                The new looks are what attracted it to me initially, but its relatively smooth drive, comfort and reliability sold me on it .\\n93

road .\\n94                             The ride is very comfortable, although I'm 6'6  and I didn't think head room was an issue but I do think leg room could be better, I think this is mainly because the back seats have tons of leg room .\\n95

              the Hyundai Sonata is thousands of dollars cheaper and matches the Camry in all respects except comfort .\\n103                                                                                        Bottom line was that I was going to be in that driver's seat for years to come and I was not going to skimp on the critical comfort factor .\\n104

                 The interior is upgraded markedly, and although there is a bit less headroom, the added telescoping feature of the steering wheel combined with the greater travel of the seat   yields greater comfort .\\n106                                                                                                                                                   , a luxurious comfort feature,

Nice looking interior but seats are very hard and are not comfortable for long trips .\\n108

                                                          The car is VERY comfortable and the air conditioning is perfect for the heat here in Arizona .\\n110

mileage and wind noise .\\n18

                                                                                                                                            Gas mileage has been a bit disappointing, but it has been improving .\\n32                                                                                                                                        the variable cylinder management changes to 4

  After owning a Honda Accord EX   I had to go back to the Honda the gas mileage can't be beat .\\n34

                                                                                                                                   It's no 8 cylinder GT, but it also gets double the gas mileage and so far, no problems .\\n37                                                                                                                              Aside from missing the turbo's acceleration, I've preferred the Accord's better mileage, handling and comfort .\\n38                                                                                                                                                          The manual transmission lets me control the car better and achieve higher mileage .\\n39                                                                                                                                                  So beware, if you are trading in your V8 for a mileage vehicle, this is not it in my case .\\n40

cylinders, as needed, to improve mileage .\\n47

                                                                                                                    Gas mileage is horrible too, 20 mpg city highway after 6000 miles .\\n60                                                                                                                                       If you are looking for a car that is affordable and well built this is the car for you bad gas mileage\\n61                                                                                                                                        In reality we have been very disappointed our in city mileage is 16, 17 and highway is better at 27 .\\n62                                                                                                                         While the mileage is not bad it good be better, but as the acceleration is good for a 4 cylinder it's a trade, off .\\n63                                                                                                                                      I am sure as gas prices go up cars will be built to get better mileage at the expense of acceleration .\\n64                                                                                                                                     Good looking inside and out, comfortable and roomy, commendable performance, and excellent gas mileage .\\n65                                                                                                                                       I live in Chicago and drive downtown and back 2 times a week for school and am getting great mileage .\\n66                                                                                                                                                        Only update is after about 5k miles the fuel mileage is less than I had anticipated .\\n67                                                                                                               Everything else such gas mileage, handling, stereo system is fine but it doesn't make up for the loud rattles and wind noise .\\n68                                                                                                                         It's almost embarrassing driving such a nice car around a parking lot and have it sound like a high mileage beater .\\n69                                                                                                                             So I saved $2 K upfront and will also save down the road since the 4 cylinder gets slightly better gas mileage .\\n70                                                                                                                                                                         It is a well built car that runs smooth and gets great gas mileage .\\n71                                                                                                                                                                                                 Gas mileage is still getting better though .\\n72                                                                                                                                                                           The gas mileage on the highway is about the same for both models .\\n73                                                                                                                                        Local mileage with the '08 has been about 24 mpg, and about 25 mpg with the '06's that we've leased .\\n74                                                                                                                                                              I decided to go back to Honda as even with high mileage they keep their value .\\n75                                                                                                                          Mileage ,  also not impressive ,  all I can get is about 24mpg, far from the 32 mpg you see on the window sticker .\\n76                                                                                                                                                                           Posted mileage ratings are for those who have a heavy right foot .\\n77                                                                                                                                                            Gas mileage is fantastic especially going from a V8 SUV to a 4 cylinder sedan   .\\n78            I was tempted to go for the V6, but I drive 42 miles one way to work and we have an '07 Odyssey with the variable cylinder management system and unless you're on long highway runs it doesn't get the gas mileage Honda claims .\\n79                                                                       I just love this car ,  and with almost double the highway gas mileage that I was getting with my Grand Cherokee ,  that adds a lot of $$ towards my monthly payment .\\n80                                                                                                                                                                                                            190 hp and superior gas mileage .\\n81                                                                                                                                                                 It wasn't worth saving the little difference in gas mileage for this Honda .\\n82                                                                                                                   The gas mileage is about 45 to the gallon going on the highway with cruise at about 800 or 900 RPM and about 38 going 70 .\\n83                                                                                                                                                  The Gas mileage is good, the acceleration sometime is slow when cold from 1st to 2nd gear .\\n84                                                                                                                                                                                     I hope to get better mileage on extended highway trips .\\n85                                                                                                          I think the mileage would be even better with a 6, speed stick shift to drop the tachometer from ~2300 rpm to <2000 rpm at 60 mph .\\n86                                                                                                                                                                      Gas mileage has been improving and is now consistently 29 hwy 22 city .\\n87

                                                   It is great to drive, has many nice features and gets you there with great mileage .\\n92

counter, so maybe they're doing work in some units .\\n38

                         The thing that bothered me the most was the bathroom was very dated .\\n41

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         The bathroom was adequate with thick, fluffy towels .\\n44                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   The bathroom was large and private .\\n45                                                                                                                                                                                                              The bathroom was very clean and well appointed with nice towels and toiletries, it was not big, but room enough to do what one needs to .\\n46                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The Tuscan Inn room was quite nicely appointed, the bed was comfortable the chairs   TV adequate, the bathroom reasonably good .\\n47                                                                                                                                       my only real complaint would be that the bathroom does not have a separate vanity area, so 2 people getting dressed had to improvise, which was kind of surprising since the bathrooms were all redone on 2005 .\\n48                                                                                                                     The clever use of mirrors behind the bed helped to create the illusion of space, however, in reality the room was cramped and with two of us trying to use the hand basin and bathroom at the same time was particularly awkward .\\n49                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The bathroom containing the toilet and the shower was also very small, not to mention the sink and counter directly outside of it .\\n50   Turning the bathroom light on also turns the counter light on, meaning a middle, of, the, night trip to the bathroom means the whole side of the room gets illuminated  and the wooden shutters that were installed in place of traditional curtains to add to the hotel's theme do absolutely nothing to keep the room dark once the sun comes up .\\n51                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The room was a good size but the bathroomm was very small .\\n52

Bathroom was adequate and clean and there was a hairdryer .\\n53

shower .\\n54                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 The bathroom had not been remodeled in alignment, but it was all very clean and perfectly acceptable .\\n55

                Bathrooms were also very nice .\\n57

              Then they gave us a room which had a view of a wall, a tiny bathroom so small in fact that the sink had to be in the bedroom .\\n59

the amenities we were looking for .\\n61

                                                                                                                                                                                           The only possible complaint was that the sink in the bathroom had a crack in it, but it did not bother me enough to ask for a different room .\\n63

                                            Bathrooms, though, are plenty big .\\n64                                                                                                                                                          Although the rooms were clean and fresh, one of ours had several small problems ,  the phone didn't work, the bathroom door handle was quite loose, and the thermostat didn't work properly .\\n65                                                                                                                                                                                                        It represents value for money, the rooms and bathrooms were impeccably clean, fresh linen daily, and the staff extremely helpful and friendly .\\n66

                           There were plenty of thick towels in the bathroom, and all the usual toiletries, hair, dryer, etc .\\n67

the staff's level of service but the rooms are small as is the bathroom .\\n68

hitting you no joke !\\n69                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Some rooms had the bathroom sink outside the bathroom, which we would have preferred, but our sink was inside the bathroom .\\n70                                                                                                                                                                             The bathroom was clean and bright and the toiletries   were so good that we took the leftovers home because there was a website selling the shampoo listed on the bottle .\\n71

could of use just a little more shelf space by the bathroom sink .\\n72

little dated .\\n73                                                                                                                                                                                                        The only thing wrong with the room was the bathroom, it was not up to the standard of the rest of the decor but it was clean and large enough .\\n74                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The bathroom was just okay, but for the price we survived .\\n75

from it's holder when anyone used the door to our room .\\n76

                                Shame that we had to use the forum restaurant this morning prior to check out ,  this restaurant is on the first floor and is one of the buffet style breakfasts so

recommendeating out as the evening food is frozen re, heat type and for the price you are paying it is not simply worth it .\\n43

day the food served wasnt changed .\\n47                                                                                                                                                                                        We ate in the bistro downstairs and the food was very good ,  although the portions varied significantly depending on the chef that night .\\n48    The buffet breakfast is ok although not the best I've had and usually includes a selection of fresh fruit as well as the usual 'full english' The food in the ground floor restaurant is good  I haven't had problems with room service although the menu has recently changed and doesn't have as good a selection as it did .\\n49

is probably the first thing worth mentioning, being a 10 minutes walk from the natural history museum, a 15 minutes walk from beautiful Hyde Park and just behind the corner of the Gloucester Road

                                        The text clarity and screen sharpness of K2 is severely disappointing and produces eye fatigue .\\n12

.\\n13  I know I need to go to the optometrist, but the Kindle will aide and abet me in avoiding that for a while , ,  the page is easy to read, the font size is easy to change, and my eyes sail across the words, my finger hits next page without me giving it thought .\\n14                                                                                                                       And with the Kindle, I can adjust the font to any of six different sizes, which is of some importance to those with poor vision or tired eyes .\\n15

me, it was no problem at all, no eye strain after reading for a few hours .\\n17                                                                                                                       I know some people are really upset about the no backlight issue, but I'm glad because it is not as straining on my eyes as a computer screen .\\n18

hurt .\\n19                                  Text to speech is adequate, I don't see myself using this feature too much, but it's a lot better than nothing when you need both hands free, and it would be a truly fantastic feature for anyone with poor eyesight or blindness .\\n20

gray page background, I actually find it easier on my eyes than stark white .\\n26                                                                 For those of us in the Boomer bulge whose eyesight is

meant to do .\\n28                                                                                                                                                                     I am loving the

                               I have been keeping an eye on the Kindle since the first was brought out and did a lot of research on this product .\\n30                                                                                                                                                                                                    and that is why it's easy on the eyes and uses very little power .\\n31                                                                                                                                                                                                               I use that as well when it gets late and my eyes tire .\\n32

were hurting .\\n34

                                                The illuminence of the light is equally distributed onto the screen which causes  no  eye strain .\\n36                                                                                                                                                                      Using the smaller font sizes causes eye strain except in daylight conditions with open windows .\\n37                                                                                                           And reading on the Kindle screen really is pleasant and natural, not to mention that my 47 year old eyes love the possibility of adjusting the text size  !\\n38

                                  Some have said they don't like the black text on a greyish background, but I find the contrast not only more than adequate but easier on the eyes than if the background were white .\\n40                                                                                                                                  A backlighted display is not easy on the

                                          I do think the e, ink e, paper is a lot easier on my eyes for reading than the glossy or matte computer screens .\\n54

                     If you have the first Kindle and are deciding whether to upgrade, do it now while you can still get a good price for your old Kindle on Amazon's Marketplace, craigslist, wherever .\\n2    Before purchasing, I was obsessed with the reviews and predictions I found online and reading about some of the critiques such as the thick border, the lack of touchscreen, lack of battery SD slot, lack of a back light, awkward difficult keyboard layout, minimally faster page flipping, and the super, high price .\\n3                                                                                                                                                                                                                    However, I think all the positives of the K2 greatly make it worth the price which I'll talk about below .\\n4                                                                                                                                                                                                                      We have all paid for our covers whether it's an  extra  cost or added in to the price of the e, reader .\\n5                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Amazon is not charging full price to replace a broken or damaged Kindle .\\n6

at $9 .\\n7                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            When the book was no longer on that list, the price could change .\\n8

The difference between the books I've purchased and the price of the Kindle is about $166 .\\n11

new releases .\\n12                                                                                                                                                                                                                      One last thing I was unaware of is how much free or nominally, priced content there is for the Kindle .\\n13

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Savings trump purchase price with Kindle's low book price advantages .\\n16                                                                                                                                                     I would have been glad to have paid any price to have had a book reader that was easier to read for myself with 20 20 vision and especially for the low, vision reader .\\n17

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                The other drawback for some is the price .\\n19

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Is the K2 so much better than the K1 as to justify the price ?\\n21

has been going up and up .\\n22                                                                                                                                                                                                 since the cost of the kindle is high anyway, the benefit, other than easy storage, was the reduced price of book downloads .\\n23                                                                                                                                                                                 The lack of such an obvious and necessary feature, especially considering the price of the device, really degrades its value and usability .\\n24                                                 I want you to know that ultimately, however, if I want a Kindle I will have to capitulate and accept Amazon's terms because Amazon has a monopoly over their own machine, and I will have to purchase one even at prices I believe are needlessly high for e, book readers .\\n25                                                                                                                                                                                And I know for sure that many print publishers will see this as an opportunity to provide attractively priced paper books as an alternative .\\n26

device we should get better quality components .\\n27                                                                                                                            To have this continuous, high speed, wireless connectivity without the need for a physical computer to upload download onto is truly amazing and makes the price of the Kindle truly irrelevant .\\n28                                                                                                                                                                                     price  , and intuitive operation your parents and grandparents can operate this device, if you are fortunate enough to still have them !\\n29

excuse to purchase it .\\n30

                                                                                                                                                                                                                 The price for new hardbacks on the Kindle is great too .\\n32

                                                                                                                                                                  The ability to plug in headphones and play Miles Davis to drown out the screaming kid while you are reading at the doctors office is priceless .\\n34                                                                                                                                                       If you are searching for a REAL review on the Kindle 2 by someone that was waiting to receive it rather than complaining about price or other issues then here it is .\\n35                          However, I will say, the selection of inexpensive books has been worth the purchase price of this item  especially for those that enjoy reading the classics or nationwide news, it has been a joy to purchase entire collections for a fraction of the cost of purchasing new or even used books .\\n36                                                                                                                                                                                           Those in college, with children or just have a love of reading will likely find the convenience and savings well worth the price .\\n37                                                                                                                                                                                                                         I found many simply by doing a search on genre's of interest with price  low to high  as a default .\\n38                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     To justify the purchase price, those functions really need to be there .\\n39                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The price of these 'classic' titles is pretty hard to beat, too .\\n40                                                                                                                                                                            I was a little miffed when i saw that they would now be charging for the Kindle cover, which was included in the price for the previous version .\\n41                                                                                                                                                                              Mind you, it's the same size as the Kindle 1, and that of most book pages, but I for one dream of something larger without a larger price tag .\\n42                                                                                                                                                                                                                 If I have to spend the full puirchase price on the K2 with a K1 still in hand I would have probably waited .\\n43                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Although pricey, the real value of this purchase is that it got me to read again .\\n44                                                                                                                                                                                        But, as far as my reading experience with the kindle 2, I have downloaded so many books and all at a fraction of the original price .\\n45                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       I just hope that the price goes down .\\n46                                                                                                                                            Yes, it costs extra, but they lowered the price on the Kindle 2 so that buying the basic cover costs plus the purchase price of the device itself equals the cost of a Kindle 1 .\\n47                                                                                                                                                                         But given my book storage issues and how much it would cost me to rent a bigger apartment here in the City, I didn't mind paying the current price .\\n48                                                                                                                                                                                                                            That may not be true for everyone, but, as I said, I'm sure the price will eventually come down .\\n49

pay for delayed convenience especially where I am located .\\n50



                                                                                                                                                                         Even if you want to , I think it is way too pricey .\\n53                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         The subscription prices and book prices are really good from what my wife tells me .\\n54                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Though it would be nice if the cover was included in the K2 price, it is still worth buying .\\n55                                                                                                                                                                                                  It is pricey but if you buy as many books as I do, it will pay for itself within a year due to the low cost of most books .\\n56                                                                                                                                                                                                The price of the device itself is the only drawback but if your an avid reader like myself the reward far outways the price .\\n57

proposition makes up for it   .\\n58

                                                                                                                                                                                                                          2, Book Selection & price,  I made a list of 20 books .\\n60

                                                                                                                                                                                         for the price of a few hundred used old, fashioned  paperbacks  and free your shelves for figurines or a nice bottle collection !\\n62

due to the insanely high price tag .\\n63

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             One, for what you get it is over priced .\\n65

font .\\n57                                                                                                                                                                                                                 The Kindle 2 is lightweight, easy to hold, easy to read, and I love the fact that I can change the size of the font, depending on my situation .\\n58                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          I am in my 50's and the reading vision isn't great so changing the font is a blessing .\\n59

newsprint, though you can change the font size to 6 or 8 different settings .\\n60

can adjust the font size as needed .\\n61

does not offer an option to view the route as a series of turn by turn directions .\\n3

               The widescreen is a plus and I highly recommend it, even though it has the wide screen you can stick it in your back pocket which can be conveniently used for walking directions .\\n5                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Garmin's nuvi 255W   is a handy little device that provides excellent value, but more importantly spot on directions .\\n6                                                 While I recommend that you refrain from entering a directions request while driving your car, I note that some of the more impressive features of this GPS are literally one touch away, and so mounting the device close enough to you to activite a one touch feature would seem to be relatively important .\\n7                                                                                                       But leaving it on the seat next to you is likely to cause a few double takes because as comfortable as you think you're going to be just listening for directions, the fact remains that the graphics will attract your eyeballs like a moth to a flame .\\n8

be excellent .\\n9                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               but for the most part, we find that the Garmin software provides accurate directions, whereever we intend to go .\\n10                                                                                                                                         Another screen at the touch of the button will show you the turn by turn directions coming up so that you can plan even better, especially in areas that you have just enough familiarity to be considered dangerous .\\n11                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              I like how the Garmin 255W doesn't make you type in complete directions when it isn't necessary .\\n12                                                                                                                                       The only other annoyance of any time is that if you deviate from your route and don't indicate that you are detouring, you get to hear the Garmin repeatedly chastize you because it has to recalulate your directions .\\n13                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   No more firing up the computer, going to the site, printing the directions .\\n14                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     It speaks the directions so that you don't have to keep looking down at a piece of paper .\\n15                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     It allows for detours with directions on how to get back .\\n16

                        The sound is tolerable, but when you are hearing spoken directions a lot, it gets really annoying .\\n20

on what you are using it for, it is a nice adjunct to a travel trip and the directions are accurate and usually the quickest, but not always .\\n24

this out, right out of the box and I hadn't even read the directions yet, , this is major easy .\\n25

spoken directions, you can look at the top of the screen for written directions .\\n30

voices to no spoken directions at all .\\n31

                                                                                                                                                                      It should tell me to take the Southwest Drive exit, or the Buffalo Gap Road exit, like the highway sign says, or like I would verbally tell someone to take if giving them directions .\\n33                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            So, although the Nuvi doesn't verbalize those directions, I can look at the screen to see the exit I need to take .\\n34                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Directions seemed to focus on Interstate travel and I have not played with the device enough to know if it can be set to avoid Interstates .\\n35

skipped directions .\\n36                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Directions were easy to see and understand .\\n37                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The spoken directions are generally easy to understand .\\n38                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Since the directions are also displayed on the screen, I find the occasional mispronunciation entertaining and not an issue .\\n39                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   It does know when you are not near a public road but it cannot give directions to the road .\\n40

 My only real gripes on the software interface side would be its inability to show 1, way streets on your overhead map   and that this particular model does not support the Garmin routing feature that you can sync between your PC and their more expensive models to pick multiple waypoints instead of just a point 'A' to point 'B' directions system .\\n42                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        You can even get turn, by, turn directions from the program, and Google Maps has features that work with Garmin units .\\n43                                                                                                                                         Any time you're facing a closed roadway or are terribly stuck in highway traffic, you'll get a very slick change in directions to your destination given to you in literally less than 5 seconds than you ask for it .\\n44

right to Carmel .\\n45                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      The purpose of the GPS is to give me directions in unfamiliar locations .\\n46                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         The voice directions are great, but sometimes it mispronounces names .\\n47

by the time I'm out on the road and actually need directions it's up and going .\\n48

driving one day in downtown Sacramento .\\n49                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      As with the 285WT, it gave me bad directions in one place in Sacramento .\\n50                                                                                                                                                                                     I avoided the more complex ones as I had read that FM updates can confuse the device and changing directions after the obstruction has been cleared is not a good option .\\n51

am using Daniel with the English accent, he seems to be clearing his throat at the end of his directions .\\n52

directions, and can recalculate quickly when I miss a turn .\\n53                                                                                                                                                                                                        Often when I'd get a phone call or was talking to someone, it would have been nice to just have the ability to quickly make the voice directions mute .\\n54                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   The directions were pretty right on, with a brief glitch with the distance it was calculating for some approaching streets .\\n55                                                                                                                                                                                                     I am sure I've not even touched upon the many features this GPS boasts, but for basic travel directions for the non, techie then this is a great product .\\n56

wife, asking her to plot a course using a mapping Web site and recite the directions .\\n57                                                                                                                   Daughter Dearest now carries the Nuvi in the glove box of her car, pulling it out, plugging it in, and getting directions whenever she needs, in a manner that notably is much faster and clearer than reading a map or calling her mother .\\n58

                                      There are different voices you can choose to give you your directions, even Australian, American and British English .\\n60                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        I mainly bought the first one for my wife since she needs directions alot of the time .\\n61

well that people from the wedding were following me for directions .\\n62

speed I am traveling .\\n63                                                                                                                                    The Voice Prompted turn by turn directions make it easy to get from one place to another without having to look up at the GPS, but of course you also get turn, by, turn directions on the GPS with a touch of the screen .\\n64

Amazon had the best price for this model which I chose for its ability to adjust the directions if you reroute, text to speech feature and 4 .\\n65

first time in several years, my husband & I took a roadtrip with no  squabbling  about directions .\\n66

if you miss a turn, it updates your route in seconds .\\n67

streets .\\n68

             The voice directions give you fair warning when you are about to take a turn, which is really important .\\n70

or airport and give you turn, by, turn directions with amazing accuracy .\\n71

and Web, based directions .\\n72

                                                                                                                                                                                       Wish I had bought it about two years ago rather than spend a lot on maps and wasting time asking directions, especially in relatively remote areas of ME .\\n74

     I spent 2 weeks driving around the Mid, West following Mapquest maps and directions .\\n75                                                                                                                                             I chose small towns as destinations and it always led me there without any problems, thus allowing me to enjoy the scenery of the fall foliage without worrying about using a map for directions or getting lost .\\n76                                                                                                                                                                                                                      I use the map feature when I don't need directions which makes it easier to identify streets when street signs are obscured or missing  .\\n77                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    On the negative side, the directions it gives to a given address are not always the best way to get there .\\n78

Practiced visiting places I already knew to see how accurate the directions and maps would be .\\n84

for directions .\\n86

                                                                                  It can be a little distracting the first few times you use it, but once you find the right mounting spot, it s like it's not there until you need it and then it's there waiting for you to with all the directions to get you to your destination .\\n88                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    I had no trouble with the volume level of the spoken directions either and found it to be an interesting and helpful tool .\\n89

both directions and street names, etc .\\n90                                                                                                                                                                          After a certain amount of frustration dealing with paper maps, missed exits and fumbling for directions in the dark ,  I decided it was time to get on the GPS car navigation wagon .\\n91                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Also, there is there no asking for directions from passengers like spouses and children who have difficulty reading conventional paper maps .\\n92                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Others have said that the voice directions leave something to be desired in terms of volume and clarity .\\n93                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            It was accurate on determing original directions and recalculating when necessary .\\n94

just 70% of volume .\\n95                                                                                                                                                                               I didnt know the address of the mueseum so I typed it into the unit and it found not only the meuseum, but the nearest garage, the places to eat, and directions were right ON .\\n96                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          The display is very easy to read, and the directions were very good .\\n97

voice was very fast and not as clear, and at times seemed a bit confused in directions .\",\n          \"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     3 quot  widescreen display was a bonus .\\n0

along displayed roads, where the 750's display was more of a  jerky  movement .\\n1                                                                                                                                                       I also found that the display on the 255w was a bit brighter, clearer, and more vivid than on the 750 in both daylight and at night .\\n2                                                                                                                                                                                                           The 750 just displays text on the top line for upcoming turns without the arrow .\\n3                                                                                                                                                                                     The 255 also automatically adjusts the font size of displayed text so that even lengthy text will fit .\\n4

your current displayed speed .\\n5                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The 255W has a really clear display that's easy to see in any light .\\n6                                                                                                              The new display posts speed limit signs of major roads flush left on the screen, which is a new feature that is also really helpful, if you're driving in an unfamiliar area .\\n7                              The widescreen display makes it possible to view the names of roads that you are passing on the screen, , which makes it much easier to differentiate between which road to turn on when there are two streets on your right   that are only one house apart .\\n8                                                                                                                                                                                                  The bad ,  My unit only displays elevation contours at zoom levels of 20 miles or higher .\\n9                                                                                                                                       UPDATE ON THIS ,  It finally turned out that to see the elevation contours at lower zoom levels   you have to reduce the amount of detail displayed .\\n10

                                                                                                                                                            My old unit counts this down for you and provides an estimate of ETA on the map display .\\n12                                                                                                                                                                                      I have to hit too many buttons to get back to the map display when, for example, I am entering POIs .\\n13                                                                                        Display is excellent ,  the layout of information on the screen is very good showing upcoming turns at the top, your speed, the local speed limit and the estimated time of arrival at the bottom .\\n14                                                                                                     In the map view, if you touch the display button to the left of the  Menu  button  , it brings up a display that features some stats about your trip and includes a compass of sorts .\\n15                                                                                                                The navigation display shows more information, such as next turn street and speed limit, and the picture update is smooth instead of jerky as I have seen in other models

For me, the visual display combined with this level of verbal instruction is just right .\\n17                                                                                                                    So I finally got the Nuvi 255w after months of analizing and comparing wit other brands, adding 3 days of looking arownd in Circuit City and Best Buy stores displays .\\n18

      I am thinking about buying another one of these for my parents because their native language is Chinese and Garmin 255W speaks and display it !\\n20

instructions sometimes are a little difficult to understand, but written at the top of the display is the next turn information .\\n22

                                                     The extra features of the 255W over lesser models that I find highly beneficial include spoken street names and the wide screen display .\\n25

                                                                                                                                                                                But is impossible to

                                                                                                                              I have really sensitive eyes and sometimes the display is too much, but there is an adjustment for it .\\n30                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The display is extremely legible both in bright sunlight and at night .\\n31   I used it the day I bought it,   and then this morning, and as soon as it comes on it is  ready to navigate  The only downfall of this product, and the only reason I did not give it 5 stars is the fact that the speed limit it displays for the road you are on isn't 100% accurate .\\n32                                                                                                                                               ,  The speed limit sign on the display is handy but in the first week of using the GPS I found it had the wrong speed limit a couple times .\\n33

                                                                                                                                                                                                        Also, if you're searching for a business, it displays the phone number .\\n35                                                                                                                                                                I also like the way the display changes background color for day and night and of course you have control of that as well .\\n36    I thought I had seen a turn by turn display but if you pick a location and wait at the GO icon you will see a Route Info slide out but it just tells you the distance and time, though if you tap on it it will show the map so you can zoom around and see the trip as it planned it .\\n37                                                                                                                                                                                Well when I saw that the 255W had the next turn proudly displayed in the upper left corner I jumped at it .\\n38

has a nice 3d display .\\n39                                                                                                                                                                                                          One unexpected feature is the speed limit and actual speed displayed on the map .\\n40

.\\n41                                                                                                                  I really like the versatility of picking destination points either by inputing an explicit address, uploading from Google Maps, or just touching a point on the display .\\n42

                  The display is laid out better than the 660 .\\n44                                                                                                                                     It is very easy to use, and when driving in the US  , it displays the speed limit and your speed, which is helpful when converting from Kms to Miles .\\n45

the display roads as you pass them .\\n46                                                                                                                                                                                                                      The display is very easy to read, and the directions were very good .\\n47

helpful .\\n48

concern .\\n6                                                                                                                             The keyboard has a responsive feel and the larger keys   along with the oversize right shift key are a real plus .\\n7                                                       The light weight, the battery life, the keyboard, the non, protruding removable battery, the bright screen, the track pad disable button and general ease of use makes it hard to beat .\\n8                                                                                                                                                 Battery life continues to hold up and the keyboard is a true godsend with its full size keys .\\n9                                                                      , Tiny and light the slightly smaller than standard keyboard is no problem for me to use, , and I'm a touch typist, , the keys themselves are a good size and feel good .\\n10                                                                                                                                                      The keyboard is quite nice and I have very large hands and I make a lot fewer mistakes .\\n11                                                                                                                                                                    The fit and finish are very good, no gaps and I like the keyboard layout .\\n12                                                                                                                                                                                                                 The keyboard is easy to use .\\n13                                                                                                                                                                       The keyboard has a decent feel but seems more cramped than the 1005ha .\\n14                                                                                                                                                                         Definitely the best looking netbook, and possibly the best keyboard .\\n15                                                           The keyboard is not quite perfect, the screen doesn't tilt back as far as I'd like, slightly higher resolution in the screen would be nice a new model not yet available in the U .\\n16                                                                                                                                                                   The keyboard, though slightly smaller than standard, is a pleasure to use .\\n17                                                                                                                                                                                          The keyboard is terrific, solid feel and full size .\\n18                                                                                                                                          The touchpad feels great, the boot up was fast, keyboard feels comfortable, and the screen is good .\\n19                                                                                                                                               The keyboard is REALLY easy to get used to, possibly the best netbook keyboard I've ever used .\\n20                                                                                                                                                             It was easy to set up, and I really liked the comfort of the mouse and keyboard .\\n21                                              The machine has the most comfortable small keyboard I've ever used, because the keys are flat and so the surfaces that your fingerpads touch are actually about the size of standard keyboards .\\n22                                                                                                                                                                         The keyboard and mouse are my biggest concern for the tiny computer .\\n23                                                                                                                                                                        The keyboard is functional, but takes a little bit of getting use to .\\n24                                                                                                                                                                                      Build quality is great, love the touchpad and keyboard .\\n25                                                                                                                                                                                 Keyboard is not as sturdy as I would like has some minor flex\\n26                                                                                                                                                                                  keyboard is actually a pleasure to use inspite of small size\\n27                                                                                                                                                                              Well, I'm a touch typist and very particular about my keyboard .\\n28                                                                                                                                                                     The only comparable keyboards I found were those on much larger laptops .\\n29                                                                                                                                                                                                          My keyboard also seems a bit noisy .\\n30                                                                                                                                                                         However, two weeks in, the keyboard would sporadically stop working .\\n31                                                                                                                       The build quality is very good, and the keyboard, though small, is surprisingly comfortable and has good key response .\\n32                                                                                                                                                          The keyboard is generous for a netbook, but I still have some trouble typing on it .\\n33                                                                                                                                                 They keyboard takes some getting used to, but even still, I could not write a novel on this .\\n34                                                                                                                                                                                       Keyboard feels funny at first, but you get used to it .\\n35                                                                                                                                                                 The keyboard isn't quite full sized of course, but very easy to get used to .\\n36                                   I have briefly tried typing on a number of netbooks since last fall, and this is the only one that had a decent keyboard just big enough to accommodate my hands and not result in multiple typing errors .\\n37                                                                                                                                         I have large hands and with a little time on the keyboard I'm breezing through word processing jobs .\\n38                                                                                                                                        I found the ASUS keyboard comfortable to type quickly  it is touch, typeable after brief acclimation .\\n39                                                                                                                                                                             The keyboard, more than 90% standard size, is just large enough .\\n40                                                                                                                                                                I picked it up right away due to the battery life, keyboard and sleek design .\\n41                                                                                                       With such a great battery life, keyboard and responsive touch pad, there's really no other model that can hold a candle to this puppy .\\n42                                                                                                                                      I think the most important thing on these small netbooks is the keyboard, and this one feels very good .\\n43                                                                                                      I notice the tighter keyboard spacing, but it seems easy to type on, yielding no more typing errors than my bad typing normally yields .\\n44                                                                                                                                                                                                               ,  keyboard feels well laid out\\n45                                                                                                      The keyboard is easy to type on  , the battery life is great, and I've found that I really do like the touch pad with all its features .\\n46                                                                                                   Speaking of which, the keyboard's relatively large size ,  at 92% of the size of a normal one ,  writing longer texts on it is no problem .\\n47                                                                                                                           While I still like the keyboard style of the Toshiba better, the EEE PC has some features that are pretty awesome !\\n48                                                                                                                                                                                     The keyboard doesn't have separation between the keys   .\\n49                                                                                                                                                            I also noticed within the second or third day of use that the keyboard was loose .\\n50                                                                                                                    I found if I pushed down and slid upward in the upper left corner, the keyboard moved up slightly and clicked into place .\\n51

                                                                                                                                                    The most noticeable difference is the screen and keyboard functionality .\\n53                                                                                                                                                       The cover and screen are glossy and it has a 92% keyboard which is plenty comfortable .\\n54                                                                                                                                                                                 Speaking of typing, the keyboard is great, almost full size .\\n55

                                                              It is smaller than a standard keyboard, but after a day or two I got used to it and now I can type pretty fast with few mistakes .\\n57                                                                                                                       I also needed Web connectivity for research, a screen with a low squint factor and a keyboard that wasn't too cramped .\\n58                                                                                                                                 I goosed up the memory to 2G and stuffed a 8G SD memory board in the slot on the right side of the keyboard .\\n59                                                                                                                                                                    The keyboard is just fine for my bony fingers & cruise, on writing speed .\\n60                                                                     And it goes in that bag wrapped in the white paper plastic bag it was originally boxed up in, with another piece of packing plastic between the keyboard and the screen .\\n61

hands have adapted completely in a few weeks .\\n63

                  It is a bit of a pain to unplug and replug power, monitor, LAN, wireless mouse keyboard, hard drive back, up and PDA cable, but not the end of the world .\\n66                                                                           4 And finally the keyboard doesn't stay fastened down at the top it would seem like an easy fix, I've noted it for repair twice and I still have the same problem .\\n67                                                                                                                       1 keyboard still floats  2the screen goes to a solid blue

Great battery life, decent sized screen, and the keyboard was large enough to be comfortable to type on .\\n69

make any adjustment when typing .\\n72                                                                                                                                                The keyboard took about 20 minutes to get used to, but i'm now typing on it very comfortably .\\n73

to be able to rotate all the way back to inline with the keyboard .\\n87

keyboard completely wrong .\\n100                                                                                                                                                                          I was also extremely impressed at how comfortable the keyboard is .\\n101                                                                                                                  I love the feel of typing on it, and have not had any issues transferring from a regular, sized keyboard to a smaller one .\\n102

                                                                                                                                                  For regular typing, the keyboard has worked well .\\n104                                                                                                                                                                  I have had a freeze up twice where the mouse and keyboard stop responding .\\n105                                                                                                                         The keyboard feel is good but the touchpad is hard and being small I get confused with the side scroll area easily .\\n106

                                                             For this extra amount, I was looking for the larger screen, the longer battery life and the keyboard ergonomics .\\n108                                                                                                                              Productivity wasn't a huge benefit, but I did feel the keyboard was a major selling point for the extra dough .\\n109                                                                                                                                             I have more productivity  flow  on a conventional laptop with a full sized screen and keyboard .\\n110                                                                                                                                                           I was afraid I wouldn't like the small keyboard, but it's really easy to type on .\\n111                                                                                                                                                                                                              Excellent keyboard for typing .\\n112                                                                                            I also have the Eeepc 900, but I can't stand typing on that keyboard ,  I've typed on this one for 10 hour work training sessions without issue .\\n113                                                                                                                                                                                     The keyboard and buttons felt good for a small netbook .\\n114                                                                                                                                                                                       The keyboard is smallish, but not ridiculously small .\\n115                                                                                                                                                                       The keyboard is surprisingly good for someone like me with big hands .\\n116                                                                                                                                                No keyboard issues on any of them, no running hot, although the adapters do get really warm .\\n117                                                                                                                                                  Windows started crashing, freezing, unable to boot, keyboard or touchpad not working, etc .\\n118                                                                                                                                                                      The keyboard is very easy to adjust to and is very comfortable to use .\\n119                                                                                                                                                                 The keyboard is nearly full size and very comfortable to type on for hours .\\n120                                                                                                                                             The keyboard is awesome since it looks like regular one with a large backspace, and two shifts .\\n121

                                                                                                                       The keyboard is only slightly smaller than a regular one, so it's very comfortable .\\n123                                                                 I mostly find that when I make typos, it's not because of the keyboard, it's because of the smallness of the screen, , I just can't see what I'm doing as well as a laptop .\\n124                                                   A lot of netbooks on the market have mangled the keyboard in one way or another such that if you are a touch typist, you find yourself hitting the wrong key often, which is frustrating .\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n
